# Hello ðŸ‘‹
My name is Peter, I am a roboticist ðŸ¤– with a passion for artificial intelligence. My work and longterm goal is to play a significant role in building ðŸ”§ the next iteration of the robotics stack.

# Using my Code ðŸ‘¾
Feel free to use code from any of my public repositories for your own projects. 

With this being said please note that I am in the process of revamping my GitHub profile and the available project work. Most of the projects currently present publically under my profile are from short class projects and as a result some of these repositories aren't as clean as I would like them to be. For such projects I will attach the `class-project` and in the case where it is not being maintained the `not-maintained` label. 

Repositories that contain the `clean-code` label are those that I believe are ready to be leveraged by others and that I will continue to maintain. These will include their own supporting documentation and will be based around robotics research projects I publish. This is something I am currently working on, be sure to check back soon for the publishing of some of these repositories.   

# A Message for You ðŸ¤—
Thanks for stopping by my GitHub profile, if you have any questions relating to my project work feel free to reach out via the email attached to my profile. Have a great rest of the day.
