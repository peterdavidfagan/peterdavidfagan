# Hello ðŸ‘‹
My name is Peter, I am a roboticist ðŸ¤– with a passion for artificial intelligence. My work and longterm goal is to play a significant role in building ðŸ”§ the next iteration of the robotics stack.

# Using my Code ðŸ‘¾
Feel free to use code from any of my public repositories for your own projects. 

With this being said please note that I am in the process of revamping my GitHub profile and the available project work. I will use the following labels to classify repositories: 


| **Label**        | **Description**  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `clean-code` | This label is for repositories that are ready to be leveraged by others and have supporting documentation |
| `class-project` | This label is for repositories that were completed as part of a class project |
| `maintained` |  This label is for repositories that I actively maintain, feel free to post issues or pull requests on these |
| `not-maintained` | This label is for repositories that I do not actively maintain |


Note: some of the class projects repositories are not as clean as I would like them to be in part due to the fact that they were completed over a short timescale and not actively maintained or developed since. These are included as they still may be useful to others in completing similar projects.

# A Message for You ðŸ¤—
