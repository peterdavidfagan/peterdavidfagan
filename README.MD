# Performing Updates to Profile ðŸ”§
I am currently participating in Google Summer of Code 2022 where I am working on the MoveIt project, my project proposal can be found [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/AICLMf2p). 

I am also in the process of updating my profile page such that it only contains repositories for robotics research or those that I help maintain. Please check back again soon for updates.
