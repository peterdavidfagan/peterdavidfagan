I’m building Corca Health, an AI-assisted ADHD screening platform designed to support GPs with early detection and triage.

My broader work focuses on preventative medicine, secure health data systems, and safe, reliable AI for clinical use. I have a background in mathematics and computer science, with a focus on artificial intelligence.
