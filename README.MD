I am actively looking for roles that leverage technology to improve patient outcomes in healthcare. I've spent the past few months learning about the healthcare industry and working on ways to modernize healthcare through my own project Saoirse Health. I am particularly interested in leveraging technology for preventative medicine by helping to prevent chronic disease through early intervention and education.

I am eager to join a team working in this space, if you are aware of a relevant opportunity please reach out.
