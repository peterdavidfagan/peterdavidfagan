I am currently focused on developing technology for preventative medicine and patient-centered health data systems. My background spans AI, robotics, and systems design. I’ve contributed to large-scale robot data collection for learning from demonstration, built reinforcement learning and imitation learning algorithms for robotic systems, designed new neural architectures for adaptive learning, and introduced methods for privacy-preserving neural inference to support secure handling of data.

I’m now building Saoirse Health, a platform for secure health data infrastructure and AI-driven clinical workflows, with the goal of improving patient health and modernizing the data systems that underpin the healthcare industry.

My interests outside of work include CrossFit, sea swimming, and hiking.
