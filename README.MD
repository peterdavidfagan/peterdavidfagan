# Hi ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ¤–
I'm Peter, a robotics researcher at the [Robust Autonomy and Decisions](https://rad.inf.ed.ac.uk/) lab at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/).

My research falls under the umbrella of robot learning, I also like to explore machine learning theory, optimisation and numerical analysis.
