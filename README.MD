# Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Peter, a robotics researcher at the [Robust Autonomy and Decisions](https://rad.inf.ed.ac.uk/) lab at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/).

My research falls under the umbrella of robot learning. I will include code for all my research projects on this GitHub profile including links to resources on the robot learning experiments I run which can be found on my Weights and Biases [profile](https://wandb.ai/peterdavidfagan). 

I am currently building infrastructure to run experiments ðŸ”§, more to come soon.
