# Hi there 👋
My name is Peter, I am a roboticist 🤖 with a passion for artificial intelligence. My work and longterm goal is to play a significant role in building 🔧 the next iteration of the robotics stack.

* 🎓 I am currently studying at Stanford University as part of the Graduate Certificate Program in Artificial Intelligence
* 🧠 I am fascinated with understanding how the mind works
* 📖 I like to write and have started publishing articles on my [site](https://peterdavidfagan.github.io/)
* 🏋️‍♂️ When I am not working on robots I love to practice CrossFit
* 💡 I had a thought to start an open source robotics project called the robot operating brain. This is currently under construction 🏗️ but check back soon for updates on how to join the project.

I like to collaborate or even just chat about the above topics, feel free to reach out to me through social links on the following [page](https://peterdavidfagan.github.io/). 

Have a great rest of the day and thanks for stopping by my GitHub profile.
