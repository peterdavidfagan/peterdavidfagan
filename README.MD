# Hello ðŸ‘‹
My name is Peter, I am a roboticist ðŸ¤– with a passion for artificial intelligence. My work and longterm goal is to play a significant role in building ðŸ”§ the next iteration of the robotics stack.

Feel free to use code in any of my repos for your own projects. 

Please note that I am in the process of revamping my GitHub profile and the available project work. Most of the projects currently present under my profile are from short class projects and as a result some of these repositories aren't as clean as I would like them to be. I will be updating this README once I have made some of my private repositories with research work ðŸ”¬ available, these repositories will be clean ðŸ§¼ and have supporting documentation so they can readily be leverage by others.  

Thanks for stopping by my GitHub profile and have a great rest of the day ðŸ¤—.
